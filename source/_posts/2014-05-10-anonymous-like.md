![Log in Anonymously](/img/2014-05-10/anonymous-login.png)

Facebook announced a new product called "[Anonymous Login]" during [F8 Conference] on April 30, 2014. The concept is great, it allows you to try out an app without releasing your personal information. We believe that we can take it a step further with [Anonymous Like].

So, during the [TechCrunch Disrupt 2014 Hackathon] in New York, we hacked together an [Anonymous Like Button][submission] to allow users to _Like it Anonymously_, similar to [Facebook Like Button]. However, the underlying principle is vastly different.

We want to create something that is simply to use and has privacy in its core. People no longer need to sign in to a platform or a service in order express their opinions. We believe that the willness of people who will click the _Anonymous Like Button_ will be much higher than the _Facebook Like Button_. Therefore, it represents a better metric on user opinions.

Check back later, as we slowly make improvement. In the meantime, feel free to click or press the _Anonymous Like_ button on <http://anonymouslike.net>.
