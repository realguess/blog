If I use GitHub to host my blog, and write the content in [Markdown][], then we not use [GitHub Flavored Markdown][github-markdown]. There are a few difference that are most relevant to me.

Fenced code blocks with syntax highlighting instead of four spaces:

```javascript
(function(){
  // Do something
}());
```

instead of four spaces:

    (function(){
      // Do something
    }());

Which is essentially the same, but GitHub flavored is better, since sometimes I write code block in Google Docs, and the syntax highlighting.

And don't forget that [emoji emoticons][emoji] are supported. :smile: :smiley: :laughing:
