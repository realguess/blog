With 28.53MB/s, the speed provided by Comcast is even faster than 64% of the United States, while at 52.83MB/s, the speed is only faster than 52% of Taiwan.

[Why is American Internet so slow?][1] "Huge telecommunication companies such as Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, and AT&T have divided up markets and put themselves in a position where they're subject to no competition." "The idea of a regulated market being more conducive to competition may be alien to free market ideologues, but telecoms and internet is a real world example of deregulation leading to monopolization instead of competition in lots of markets."
