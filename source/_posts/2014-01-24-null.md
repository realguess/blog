In JavaScript, you assign value `null` to an object property to indicate that the property is defined but with no value. But using `null` outside the JavaScript domain becomes tricky. For example, in URL query parameters:

    ?foo=null&bar=bar

after parsing the query:

    {
      "foo": "null",
      "bar": "bar"
    }

Should the value of `foo` be parsed from `"null"` string into `null` object? Unless you know the context.

Using `null` in both schema design and URL query gave me a few headaches. So, I have decided to use string and throw away `null`.  As string is the most basic data type across many applications. For simplier design and greater compatibility and portability, use empty string instead of `null`.

Therefore, the value of query parameter `foo` should be:

    ?foo=null&bar=bar // "null"
    ?foo=&bar=bar     // ""

and:

    "null" !== ""
