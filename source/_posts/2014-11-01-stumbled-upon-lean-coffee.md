Stumbled upon [Lean Coffee]. [Lean] movement adventures into coffee brewing? No, it is about structured, but agenda-less meeting with participants generated topics, or _lean meeting_. It is not truly agenda-less, but the topics of the meeting agenda are participant-sourced and participant-judged or voted. So, instead of top-down, but more democratic and bottom-up approach.

The structure of Lean Coffee has three major components:

- To discuss
- Discussing
- Discussed

Similar structure has already permeated in some other areas, such as [Trello]:

And there is an app (webapp) for that: [Qoffee].

However, does Lean Coffee work? Will it fall into the prey of [groupthink]? I don't know. But it is time to find out.
