Understand that success is a byproduct of achieving your goals, and setting your
goals takes time and practice.

Steps:

1. Define clear and measurable goals
3. Work towards your goals everyday
4. Track and measure your progress

```CoffeeScript
types     = ['personal', 'professional', 'habit']
durations = [
  'lifetime', 'long term', 'short term',
  'year', 'week', 'today'
]

goal =
  title: 'Write a blog once a week'
  body: 'Spend 1 or 2 hours each week, preferably on
    Saturday, review the most important thing you have
    learned in the past week, and blog about it.'
  types: ['personal', 'habit']
  tags: ['blog']
  duration: 'short term'
```
