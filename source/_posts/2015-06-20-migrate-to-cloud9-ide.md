My [blog] is powered by [Hexo]:

> Hexo is a fast, simple and powerful blog framework. You write posts in Markdown (or other languages) and Hexo generates static files with a beautiful theme in seconds. - <https://hexo.io/docs/>

To generate static files, I need a [Node.js] development environment. But as I move around from different computers and operating systems, this becomes inconvenient. I need a cloud development environment where I can access it from any device.

So, I have decided to move my blog to [Cloud9] IDE, a development environment in the cloud. And this is the first blog from the environment.

Looking forward!
