ShellShock is a Bash vulnerability, which allows bypassing environment restrictions in certain environments. See [Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2363-1][1]. And for more detailed description, see [CVE-2014-7169][2].

This Bash bug can be potentially bigger than the [Heartbleed] bug, because Bash shell is usually the default shell for the user, and many commands will also spawn Bash to execute. See this answer <http://askubuntu.com/a/528102> from StackOverflow.

Running the following command will determine if the system is vulnerable or not:

```
$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
```

Luckily, this is relatively easy to patch. Simple `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` will patch the Bash with the latest security fix. For example, this is a patched Bash version:

```
$ bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.2.25(1)-release
```

This is for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. If you are running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you have to
upgrade to [Bash 4.3-7ubuntu1.3][3].
