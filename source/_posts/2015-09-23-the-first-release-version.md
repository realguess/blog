When you have a release for the first time, how do you name your release version based on [SemVer]? `1.0.0`, `0.1.0` or `0.0.1`?

I like to start off with `0.1.0`. Because version `0.0.0` means there is nothing. Then from nothing to something, that's breaking change, hence version `0.1.0`.

[SemVer]: http://semver.org/
