# Leaving New Orleans

[Huey P Long Bridge] across the Mississippi River, SuperDome and New Orleans behind us. Now here I can talk about New Orleans, the culture of food and drink. If you look at the Amtrak System map, it is a hub for three long distance Amtrak routes, Sunset Limited, Crescent and City of New Orleans (between Chicago and New Orleans). Next hub is San Antonio. The Sunset Limited is used to extend to Jacksonville, Florida. But due to Katrina, the service is suspended.

# Bayous of Louisiana

Bayous of Louisiana. Tree, lakes, rivers. Learn a little bit about it. And why.

# Into Texas

The first stop in Texas is Beaumont, TX.

# Type of Train

- Superliner is much bigger double deck.
- More comfortable than Viewliner

We are staying on the second floor, on the left side, so should be a better view.


# The View

In the South, it is truck dominant area.
