Why do you come up with such a routine? Because success is a marathon, not a sprint.

Assign yourself three major tasks everyday. Toggle the hardest one first.

> Plan then stick to your plan.

So, you have defined your routine, now you have to stick to it and improve it everyday.

I am really struggle at this on sticking to the plan.


# Prioritization

_How to balance do a little everyday, priority and have to do?_ You just have it in reveresed order.


# Sunday

Take a one day off each week, no matter how busy (New Year Resolution)? I choose this day to be Sunday.

On Sundays, give yourself a break. Not only can benefit your creative juices but also your health.

# Team

Weekly planning should work better than daily micro-management.
