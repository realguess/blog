# Getting Started

> Fares are classified into different fare categories (Saver, Value and Flexible) based on common refund rules and restrictions for each category.
>
> Saver Fares are the lowest available fares and include deeply discounted offers (14-day advance purchase, flash fares, web only). Saver Fares are non-refundable but can be canceled with the ticket value saved as credit in an eVoucher that can be used for future Amtrak travel. The Saver Fare is not available on all trains and buses. The number of seats available on each train at the Saver Fare is limited.
>
> Value Fares offer several refund options. Value Fare tickets are fully refundable if canceled more than 24 hours prior to the scheduled departure from the origin but will incur a 10% refund fee if canceled less than 24 hours prior to departure. Value Fare tickets can be canceled with the ticket value saved as a credit in an eVoucher that can be used for future Amtrak travel.
>
> Flexible Fares are 100% refundable without any refund fee. Flexible Fare tickets can be canceled for a full refund of the ticket value or with the ticket value saved as a credit in an eVoucher that can be used for future Amtrak travel. The Flexible Fare is available on most trains and buses. The number of seats available on each train at the Flexible Fare is limited.

The difference between _Saver_ and _Value_ is the booking time and non-refundable. _Flexible_ is twice the cost of _Saver_.

Does it matter when you are booking?

Each ticket has two free checked bags (size?)

So we might want to bring our own pillow for one-time use.

### Viewliner Roomette

> The Viewliner Roomette is designed for one or two passengers, with comfortable reclining seats on either side of a sweeping picture window. At night, the seats convert to a bed and an upper berth is lowered down from the ceiling.

Sink and toilet in room, but showers nearby, fresh towels and bed linens (so probably we do not need to buy our own pillows)>

At night, the seats convert to a comfortable bed, and an upper berth folds down from above. Roomettes are located on both upper and lower levels of our double-decker Superliner train cars.
